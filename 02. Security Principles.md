# Security Principles 
## Learning Objectives : 
- Understand the CIA Triad and its importance.
- Explain Risk, Privacy, and Accountability.
- Relate security principles to real-world cyber incidents.

# CIA Triad 
- The CIA Triad forms the foundation of information security.
- Each element ensures that information remains safe and trustworthy. 

| Element                  | Description                                                 | Example                                                       |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|**Confidentiality**       |Ensures data is accessible only to authorized users.         | Encrypting files, using passwords, access control lists.      |
|**Integrity**             |Ensures data is accurate, consistent, and not tampered with. | Using hashing, digital signatures, checksums.                 |
|**Availability**          | Ensures systems and data are available when needed.         | Redundant servers, backups, DDoS protection.                  |

## Key Concepts
- **Data breaches often occur when one or more CIA principles are compromised.**
- **Balance is key – too much focus on one (e.g., availability) can weaken another (e.g., confidentiality).**


# Examples
- **Confidentiality Violation :** Unauthorized access to customer data (e.g., Facebook-Cambridge Analytica case).
- **Integrity Violation :** Tampered medical data in hospitals leading to misdiagnosis.
- **Availability Violation :** DDoS attack on banking websites preventing service access.

# Risk, Privacy, and Accountability

# Risk
- **Definition :** Probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability to cause harm.

## Components :
- **Threat :** something that can cause damage.
- **Vulnerability :** weakness that can be exploited.
- **Impact :** damage if threat is realized.

## Formula :
 **Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Impact**

## Example :
- Threat-> Phishing
- Vulnerability-> Employee lack of awarness
- Impact-> credential theft, financial loss

## Privacy
- Protecting personal and sensitive information of individual.
- Governed by laws like GDPR, DPDP Act(India), HIPAA.

## Key Practises :
- Data minimization
- Informed consent
- Data anonymization
Example : A healthcare app must not share user health data without consent

## Accountability
Ensuring every action in an IT system can be traced back to an individual.
## Acheived through
- Logging and auditing
- User accss tracking
- Non-repudiation mechanisms
Example : audit logs in firewalls to trace malicious user actions.
