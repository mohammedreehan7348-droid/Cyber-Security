# Fundamental of Cyber Security
## Identificsliom, Authentication, and Authorization


| Concept             | Description           | Example                             |
|---------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|
|**Identification**   | Claiming an identity  | Typing username                     |
|**Authentication**   | Proving identity      | Entering password / fingerprint     |
|**Authorization**    | Granting access       | Accessing certain files after login |

## Key Principle :
"Authentication verifies who you are. Authorization decides what you can do."

# Authentication Methods
- Knowledge-based : Passwords, PINs
- Possession-based : Smart cards, OTP tokens
- Inherence-based : Biometrics (fingerprint, face ID)
- Multifactor Authentication (MFA) : Combination of 2 or more above
- Single Sign-On (SSD) : One time login across multiple systems ( e.g., Google or Microsoft SSO )

# Authorization Models
- DAC (Discretionary Access Control): Owner decides who can access ( windows permissions ).
- MAC (Mandatory Access Control): Access based on classification levels ( military systems ).
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): Permissions assigned to roles ( Admin, Manager, User ).
- ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control): Access based on conditions ( time, location, user type ).

## Example :
An "HR Manager" role can view employee data, while "Employee" role can only view their own profile.

# Best Practices 
- Use strong and unique passwords.
- Apply MFA wherever possible.
- Review role-based permissions regularly.
- Log all authentications and access events.
